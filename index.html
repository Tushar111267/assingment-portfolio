            <p>Today’s web development landscape is full of innovative projects and intelligent people. Together, these factors push the industry forward at amazing speeds, while also making it more difficult for individual web developers to be outstanding. As a solution to this problem, web developers create portfolios that will make them stand out.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Some developers find web-based portfolios to be redundant, mostly because today there are a number of quicker, easier ways to share your work and gain the desired recognition. You could use Twitter, Dribbble, dev.to, and GitHub to name a few of the more useful.</p>
